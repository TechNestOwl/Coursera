# Coursera

    My goal for enrolling in this course is to galavnize 
    my current knowledge base of programming in Javascript,
    and to bridge the gaps of understaing in advanced concepts.

    I have a dedicated work space in which I also use to work my 
    remote job as a full-stack instructor at DigitalCrafts immersive bootcamp.

    I keep myself accountable and meet deadlines set by the course curriculum and actively take notes. Where I can, I contribute to online disccusions and help bolster the concepts covered for other colleagues in this course.
