Semantics Tags:

Article Element - indicates content which represents a complete or self-contained composition
in a document page application or site that is independently distributable. 
    ex: 
        - forum Post
        - Article
        - blog Post
        - user comment
        - interactive widget
        - or any other idependant item or content

It is good practice to use the article element within the 'main' tag. As well as other tag such as heading and p tags
This is becasue the 'main' element semantically represents the main content of the page.

Use the section element to semantically define individual sections of the article. 
Note: section elements should contain a heading tag to semantically define those sections.
