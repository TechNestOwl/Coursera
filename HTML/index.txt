        ** Form Action and Method:

It is important to note that action can be a full URL address such as https://meta.com,
 an absolute path such as /login, or a relative path such as login. 

The absolute path, which starts with a forward slash, will use the base address of the
 current website, such as https://meta.com and combine it with the absolute path. 
 For example, if /login is the absolute path, the form will be submitted to
  https://meta.com/login. If the address is https://meta.com/company-info/ and /login 
  is the absolute path, the submission address will still be https://meta.com/login.

Similarly, a relative path will combine the current web address with a relative path.
 For example, if the web browser is currently on the web page 
 https://meta.com/company-info/, and the relative path is set to login, the form will 
 be submitted to https://meta.com/company-info/login. 





        ** iFrame sandbox cheat sheet **

The <iframe> is the inline frame element that embeds an HTML page into another page.  

Apart from the global attributes, which can be a part of the iframe, major element-specific attributes are listed below. 

Allow 
    It specifies what features or permissions are available to the frame, for instance, access to the microphone, camera, other APIs and so on. For example: 

    allow="fullscreen” the fullscreen mode can be activated 

    allow=“geolocation” lets you access the user’s location 

To specify more than one feature, a semicolon-separator should be used between features. For example, the following would allow using the camera and the microphone: 

<iframe src="https://example.com/…" allow="camera; microphone"> </iframe> 

Name 
    The name for the <iframe>. For example: 

    <iframe name = "My Frame" width="400" height="300"></iframe>  

Height 
    It specifies the height of the frame. The default value is 150, in terms of CSS pixels. 


Width
    Specifies the width of the frame, in terms of CSS pixels. The default value is 300 pixels.

Referrerpolicy 
    A referrer is the HTTP header that lets the page know who is loading it. This attribute indicates which referrer information to send when loading the frame resource. The common values are: 

    no-referrer The referrer header will not be sent. 

    origin The referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page 

    strict-origin The origin of the document is sent as the referrer only when using the same protocol security level (HTTPS to HTTPS) 


    Sandbox 

    - To enforce greater security, a sandbox applies extra restrictions to the content in the <iframe>. To lift particular restrictions, an attribute value (permission token) is used. The common permission tokens are listed below: 

    - allow-downloads Allows the user to download an item 

    - allow-forms Allows the user to submit forms 

    -  allow-modals The resource can open modal windows 

    - allow-orientation-lock Lets the resource lock the screen orientation 

    - allow-popups Allows popups to open 

    - allow-presentation Allows a presentation session to start 

    - allow-scripts Lets the resource run scripts without creating popup windows 










        ** Interactive form elements with Validation ** 

Required
Denotes a mandatory input that the user can’t leave empty. It can be used with any input type, like password, radio, text and so on. 

<input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName" required> 

Maxlength 
Specifies the maximum length of a text input, in other words, the maximum number of characters that can be entered for a specific field. If provided, it will prevent the user from entering more characters than the limit. 

<input type="text" id="description" name="description" maxlength="50"> 

Minlength 
Specifies the minimum length of a text input. If set, the input will not accept fewer characters than those specified. 

<input type="password" id="password" name="password" minlength="8"> 

Min and max attributes 
Determine the minimum and maximum values allowed for an input field. They are usually applied to numerical text inputs, range inputs or dates. 

<input type="number" id="quantity" name="quantity" min="1" max="10"> 

<input type="range" id="volume" name="volume" min="1" max="100"> 

Multiple 
Indicates that the user can enter more than one value in a single input field. This attribute can only be used for email and file input types. 

<input type="file" id="gallery" name="gallery" multiple> 

Pattern 
Defines a particular pattern that an input field value has to fulfill to be considered valid. This attribute expects a regular expression to specify the pattern. It works with text, date, search, URL, tel, email and password input types. For example, you can restrict phone numbers to be only from the UK. 
<input type="tel" id="phone" name="phone" pattern=”^(?:0|\+?44)(?:\d\s?){9,10}$” >

Semantics Tags:

Article Element - indicates content which represents a complete or self-contained composition
in a document page application or site that is independently distributable. 
    ex: 
        - forum Post

        - blog Post
        - user comment
        - interactive widget
        - or any other idependant item or content

It is good practice to use the article element within the 'main' tag. As well as other tag such as heading and p tags
This is becasue the 'main' element semantically represents the main content of the page.
