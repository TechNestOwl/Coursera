JS modules:

Modules are .js files that export a function or functions. 
There are two main methods of exporting a module...
*   Default export:

    function addTwo(a,b){
        return a + b;
    };

    export default addTwo;

*   Named export:

    function addTwo(a,b){
        return a + b;
    }

    export {addTwo};


Importing a module is just as easy.

importing default: At the top of the import file..
    
    import default: import addTwo from "./addTwo.js"
    named import:   import {addTwo} from "./addTwo.js"



React treats lowrecase components as regualr HTML elements.
This is why capatilizing components is important to distinguish JSX components.  

Transpiling converts JSX into HTML.
 Babel does is this: it allows you to transpile JSX code (which cannot be understood by a browser) 
 into plain JavaScript code (which can be understood by a browser).




Organizing React File Structure:

Two Main Approaches..
1. Grouping by features.
2. Grouping by file type.

Don't nest folders too deep. Keep it simple.

        JSX:
JSX allows me as a developer to write HTML directly inside Javascript code. 
Once I pass props parameter to a funcitonal component, I can then access that objects properities with dot notation. 
The "HTML" code in JSX needs to be wrapped in a top level element, or at least a 'fragment' => <>   </>
Since class is already used in JavaScript, "className" is used instead. Note the camelCase.

Anything that is placed within curly braces in JSX, is essentially javascript code. 
ex: 
JSX...
function List(props){

    return(
        <ul>
            <li>{2 * 2}</li>
            <li>{"He" + "Him"}</li>
            <li>{16/2}</li>
            <li>{props.firstName}</li>
        </ul>
    )
};

export default List;

        Props and Childeren

props.children is automatically passed to every component. 

This:
<Example children="I'm a child porp" />

is the same as: 

<Example>

    I'm a child prop

</Example>

The "I'm a child prop" is  a texst child of the Example component.
